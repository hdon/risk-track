Based on create-react-app.

This app will help you keep track of player stats during a game of Risk
playing by classic rules.

I have literally done zero apps that were react without redux and without
typical client-server CRUD capabilities at a minimum. I've created
`front-end/` and `back-end/` directories (you're now reading the README for
the front-end) in anticipation of adding a back-end, but I have developed
this application entirely as a react-only front-end-only application.

So, this is largely an exercise for me in using only react. I wanted to
know what it would be like. It is pretty much how I imagined it, I guess...
